This is just a practice exercise.
I used setter and getter methods .Getter and setter methods are frequently used in Java programming. 
Getter and setter methods in Java are widely used to access and manipulate the values of class fields. 
Usually, class fields are decorated with a private access specifier.
Thus, to access them, public access specifiers are used with the getter and setter methods.
